Simple mod interface request

Make "electric network id" of "pole" entities available to mods.
Reason:
I want to make a feature to my PowerIsolate mod which keeps isolated power networks isolated when creating new poles:

When you build a new pole it's automatically connected to all adjacent poles, which results in that you cant easily manage two power networks co-existing in same area.

I want to make a feature to my mod which "on_build": a checkbox "lock electric network",
when it's set - all new poles will only be able to connect to
