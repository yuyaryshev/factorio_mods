# Surfaces

A mod that provides an interface for other mods to create new surfaces on different "layers" of "planets" or "dimensions". It provides transportation of entities, items and fluids between these surfaces.

This is the new base mod for [surfaces-caves](https://gitlab.com/Danacus/surfaces-caves).

Heavily inspired by the [Surfaces mod by Simcra](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Surfaces), but it has other goals, so I decided to write my own mod from scratch.
