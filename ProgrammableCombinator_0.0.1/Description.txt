Very early version (0.1)

The reason: 
I hate circuit wires. I can't really see where it goes from and to. It's messy.

Description:
- This combinator combines up to 16 operations in one unit
- It have 4 inputs and 4 outputs.
- Inputs support separate channels (so it's actually 8 inputs)
- It supports additional operations which can't be accomplished by vanilla combinators

Working features:
- Operations: + - * / min max		(not deeply tested, but should work)
- Copy and paste - copies the program
- Export and import through edit box

Problems:
- Graphics are awful... (I'm really bad with graphics so I won't fix this myself...)
	- And layout of all the entities. I want this thing to be small (1x1 at best) but, i couldn't make it to work with the blueprints
- Blueprints won't save the program (I don't know a way to save it into the entity)
- No technology yet
- Receipe is 1 iron for now

Your help would be appreciated and is needed:
- Helping with how to implement saving program to a blueprint
- With graphics
- With testing
- With suggestions for balance
- With suggestions of new useful functions
- Any other feedback

Disclamer:
- This mod is really unstable and untested. You can kill your save, so make backups.
- I don't really know if i'm going to finish all this because of big problems I mentioned above and lack of time

License:
- It's absolutely free - use, copy, fork, do whatever you like...
- In fact I'll be glad if someone experianced and who really love to make mods take it and make it to the production.
