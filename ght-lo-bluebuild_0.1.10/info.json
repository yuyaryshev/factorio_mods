  "description": "Allows automatic blueprint building and deconstruction without bots. Once a blueprint is placed, nearby entities will be auto-placed as long as you have the objects in your inventory and are standing still. Once items are marked for deconstruction, they will be auto-removed and put into your inventory as long as you are standing still. Deconstruction speed is based on the mining time and the currently used tool. Press SHIFT+K to toggle building, press SHIFT+L to toggle deconstruction.",
