Inserters antifreeze (antiblock)

Sometimes an inserter is holding an item which can't be inserted into target and it freezes (locks). Only way to release it is manually. 
This mod fixes this. How? It monitors all your inserters and if found a problem it will reverse inserter, wait until it put's the item back and then restores it. 
When the problem this happens: 

Solved cases:
- You placed new factory after you placed an inserter.
- When stack inserter is loading train and is not able to put all the stack into the train

Unsolved cases:
- Smelting steel and iron and/or stone togather 
- Loading from fully loaded belt - here inserter just don't have any place to put what it's holding.

Concept:
I like the solution to be more natural and realistic - if I imagine an inserter it really can be programmed to turn around in some cases.
But teleporting hand's contens somewhere away isn't "natural".

Ideas (not implemented yet):
If an inserter is frozen drop item on the ground and mark it for deconstruction by construction robot.

If you have any ideas how to solve inserter locking problems in more an elegant way - please share.
