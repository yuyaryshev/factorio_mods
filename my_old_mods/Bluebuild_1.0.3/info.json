  "description": "Allows blueprints to be used much earlier.  Once a blueprint is placed, nearby entities will be auto-placed at 10/second so long as you have the objects in inventory and are standing still.  Once items are marked for deconstruction, they will be auto-removed and put into inventory so long as you are standing still.  Press b to toggle building, press n to toggle demolishing.",
