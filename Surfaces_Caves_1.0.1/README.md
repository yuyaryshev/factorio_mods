# Surfaces Caves

Cave generation for the upcoming [Surfaces mod](https://gitlab.com/Danacus/surfaces-redux/tree/next). 
Originally based on the [Caves](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Caves) mod by CaveGrinder. Currently the original graphics by CaveGrinder are used, but they will probably be replaced soon.
New Cave generation uses Perlin noise instead of Cellular Automata, for simplicity and better performance.

## Future ideas

- Dungeons
- Loot
- Exploration
- Bosses?
- Alternative recipe unlocks from dungeon rewards?
- Higher ore yield below the surface.
